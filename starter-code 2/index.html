          Christmas in Singapore is a big celebration that gives locals another excuse to do what they love most to eat and shop.
    
          At its heart, the holiday is still a special day for Christians in Singapore, who attend Christmas service in commemoration of the birth of Jesus Christ. It is a religious celebration like any other, and regardless of your religious beliefs, everyone gets to take part in the fun of frolicking in fake snow, men in santa suits and of course, Christmas presents.

          Feng
          Definitely an acquired taste, this uniquely Eurasian dish makes its appearance during Christmas. Feng is a rich stew made of pig innards (intestines, heart, stomach, liver, kidney lungs and so on), ground spices and plenty of garlic, shallots and ginger.

          <h6> 
            Devil Curry
          </h6>

          How did this dish get its name? Probably because it is hot, and because of its fiery red colour. It is believed to have originated with the Eurasians of Malacca in Malaysia, and then brought to Singapore. It is prepared using the traditional Christmas meal leftovers. So it includes ham, sausages, roast turkey, and roast pork, as well as cabbage, carrots, onions and tomatoes.

It is becoming increasingly difficult to find good sugee cake in Singapore, because it is labour intensive to prepare well, and uses costly ingredients.
