      Christmas in Singapore is a big celebration that gives locals another excuse to do what they love most—Eat and shop.

      At its heart, the holiday is still a special day for Christians in Singapore, who attend Christmas service in commemoration of the birth of Jesus Christ. It’s a religious celebration like any other, and regardless of your religious beliefs, everyone gets to take part in the fun of frolicking in fake snow, men in santa suits and of course, Christmas presents!
